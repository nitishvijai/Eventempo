# Eventempo
Short answer: Multiple event countdown timer written in C# (UWP)

Long answer: Eventempo is an UWP countdown timer app for Windows 10 devices. Simply enter in a new event and the app will show you how many years, months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds are left until the event.

Some features include:

* support for multiple event countdown timers
* easy add/edit event page
* automatic saving of events in between sessions
* year/month/day/hour/minute/second countdown
* colorful event customization
* notification alerts at 5 minutes remaining and at time

This is my first app and I'm learning more UWP dev. concepts as I code, so if you have ideas/suggestions as to how I can improve this app, please let me know at nitishv.apps@outlook.com or feel free to open an issue here. All comments are much appreciated!
